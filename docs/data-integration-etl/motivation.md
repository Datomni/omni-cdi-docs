# Motivation

Omni ETL runs in your own cloud environment, avoiding costly subscriptions of traditional cloud platforms as data volumes rise. You control the infrastructure, allowing for potential savings by reserving instances. Additionally, Omni ETL operates efficiently even on modest hardware setups due to its minimal resource requirements.

Most SaaS-based ETL tools have rigid scheduling options. In contrast, Omni ETL, powered by Python-Celery, offers complete schedule customization. This flexibility allows tasks such as syncing data at specific times (like dawn or dusk) or triggered by external events such as weather updates.

Integrating CDP data with third-party cloud tools can be tricky due to schema differences. Omni ETL simplifies this by writing extracted data directly into the unified Omni CDI data schema. This streamlined process makes it easier to integrate and enhance event data through third-party ETL tools.

Unlike many ETL solutions that focus solely on extraction and loading, Omni ETL stands out by supporting advanced transformations. Its Python backend enables sophisticated operations like statistical analysis and outlier removal, ensuring optimal data quality.
