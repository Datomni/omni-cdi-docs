# Motivation

In a world where the main focus is often on data volume, Omni Analytics also places a strong emphasis on data quality and the acquisition of knowledge from data. We believe that more data is valuable only if it yields more knowledge. Omni Analytics aims to maximize knowledge per unit of data processed. This is achieved by processing raw, unstructured events early in the data flow and minimizing the noise they carry.

Omni Analytics addresses flaws in data ingestion operations. Traditional Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) often adhere to simplistic Source-Destination logic, resulting in several issues:

1. **Degraded data warehouse quality:** Poorly validated events can disrupt data models and control over data.
2. **Wasted marketing budgets:** Low-quality data can lead to suboptimal ad optimization in ad platforms.

Omni Analytics ensures that raw data undergoes necessary transformations, reducing noise and enhancing data quality before it reaches any business processes. Like a well-functioning factory, its objective is to produce structured, clean, and high-quality end products—data, in this case—for all downstream applications and consumers.
