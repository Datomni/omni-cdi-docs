# Introduction

Omni CDI is built to be modular. This means you can mix and match different components to build exactly the data system you need. Each part of Omni CDI works independently but can be connected with other parts as needed.

Here's what makes this modular approach powerful:

1. **Build what you need**: Pick only the components you want. Need data collection and analytics, but not activation? No problem. Want to start small and add more later? You can do that too.

2. **Adjust resources as needed**: Put more power behind the parts that matter most to your business. If you need heavy analytics but light activation, you can configure it that way.

3. **No vendor lock-in**: Unlike all-in-one platforms, you're not stuck with one vendor's monolithic system full of features you don't need and assumptions that don't work for your business. Switch out any component whenever you want.

4. **Your business, your rules**: The system follows your business logic. You decide how data should flow and how your system should work.

In this guide, we'll show you common ways to combine Omni CDI components to solve real business problems.
