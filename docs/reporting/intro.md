# Introduction

Omni Reporting is the layer of Omni Customer Data Infrastructure focused on real-time reporting. Like other layers of Omni CDI, the reporting layer is designed to operate in the private cloud. Under the hood, it uses the open-source Metabase. It connects to various data warehouses that store data processed by Omni Analytics and Omni Activation, which is ingested through the end-to-end pipelines of Omni Infrastructure/Warehousing.
