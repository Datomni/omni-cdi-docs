# Introduction

Omni Infrastructure is a key development within Omni CDI. Currently, we provide both individual and end-to-end pipelines to run the warehousing component on AWS. We are working to expand support for more databases, focusing on columnar storage for large analytical queries. Future enhancements include CI/CD pipeline integrations and expanded cloud support, including Google Cloud and AWS.
