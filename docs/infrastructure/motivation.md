# Motivation

To enable rapid deployment of the infrastructure layer, we use Terraform. This open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool from HashiCorp automtaes everything from server and database management to networking and security configurations.

Hereâ€™s why we value Terraform:
- **Consistency**: Terraform deploys infrastructure consistently across environments by defining it as code, eliminating manual configuration errors.
- **Version control**: Infrastructure configurations can be versioned like software code, facilitating change tracking, collaboration, and rollback.
- **Automation**: Terraform automates the infrastructure lifecycle, reducing the time and effort needed for provisioning, scaling, and decommissioning.
- **Scalability**: Terraform scales infrastructure up or down based on demand, ensuring efficient and cost-effective resource use
