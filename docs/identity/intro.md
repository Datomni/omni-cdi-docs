# Introduction
Omni Identity is a Dockerized application designed for identity resolution and enrichment. This tool is built to help you conduct in-depth analytics across the entire user journey by providing persistent identity data storage and seamless integration with various data channels.

Omni Identity unifies user activities across different touchpoints, allowing for a comprehensive view of individual user behavior. It also enriches incoming events in real-time, as demonstrated by the [Omni Conversion Meta API](/docs/activation/ssGTM/tags/meta-api), where Omni Identity serves as one of the key enrichment sources, following the general execution flows of Omni Activation tags as outlined in our [activation architecture diagram](/docs/activation/motivation).

The application is deployed in a Docker-based environment and is included as part of the Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation. To schedule your PoC and learn more about how Omni Identity can enhance your business analytics, please [visit our contact page](https://www.datomni.com/contact).

This documentation focuses on technical implementation details and configuration guidelines. For business-oriented information and product overview, please visit our [Omni Identity product page](https://www.datomni.com/products/omni-identity).
