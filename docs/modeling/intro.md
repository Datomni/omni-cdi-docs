# Introduction

The Modeling layer takes your raw data and turns it into useful business metrics. It's that simple. 

Here's what makes it powerful:

1. **Entire customer journey**: We're working to connect every step of your customer's path - from first click to loyal customer. This means you can see exactly how people interact with your business and quickly spot what's working (and what isn't).

2. **Ready-to-use business metrics**: No more complicated data work. You get the metrics you need, ready to use. Want conversion rates? Revenue numbers? Customer engagement scores? We've built these for you already.

The Modeling layer plugs right into your Omni CDI setup in your private cloud. It grabs the raw data from Omni Analytics and Omni Activation, and processed through Omni Warehousing, and turns it into numbers you can actually use to run your business better.

You get:
- One place for all your business metrics
- Pre-built models that work right away
- Data you can trust
- Clear insights for growing your business

Right now, we have several well-built data models, including two that are open source. We're working on releasing more models soon. Everything currently works with BigQuery and dbt.
