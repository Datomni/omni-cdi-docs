# Intro

Many companies miss out on advanced, real-time analytics because they assume it's only feasible for large corporations with substantial data teams. Omni CDI challenges this assumption by making enterprise-grade data infrastructure accessible to companies of all sizes.

Omni Customer Data Infrastructure (CDI) is a primarily open-source platform for building your private, containerized data infrastructure. It enables:

- Real-time event capture and processing
- Data transformation and formatting
- ETL task management
- Full data ownership and control

## Core Features

- **Containerized Architecture**: Built entirely with Docker and Terraform for easy deployment and scaling
- **Modular Design**: Pick and choose components based on your needs
- **Production Ready**: Currently processing live events across multiple deployments
- **Source Available**: Most components are open source with full transparency
- **Privacy First**: Your data stays in your infrastructure

## Key Benefits

1. **Cost Effective**: Enterprise-grade capabilities without enterprise-level costs
2. **Quick Setup**: Containerized deployment gets you running in hours, not weeks
3. **Flexible Integration**: Works with your existing tools and data sources
4. **Real-time Processing**: Immediate data availability for analytics and actions
5. **Full Control**: No vendor lock-in, complete data ownership

## Getting Started

1. Deploy your Omni Analytics instance
2. Configure your event capture endpoints
3. Start processing real-time data flows
4. Add ETL micro-applications as needed (e.g., Google Search Console integration)
